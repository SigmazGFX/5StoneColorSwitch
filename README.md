Code for 5 color stone prop.

in this original idea five back or edge lit stones will need to be pressed to change their illuminated color.
Once all 5 colors are set properly the unlock event will be triggered (pins D12/D13)

This design can be modified for any number of prop styles where colors need to be cycled with thier associated buttons.
